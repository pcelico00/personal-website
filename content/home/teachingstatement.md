I debuted my teaching experience since my teenage years offering private summer lessons to younger pupils in my neighborhood. Since then, I have grown up with this dear "spirit of knowledge sharing". Every Summer during my undergraduate degree, I used to teach to prospective students preparing the tests for admission to the Faculté des Sciences of the Université d’Etat d’Haiti, a school reputed as the top engineering school in the country. Soon after I graduate from the Faculté des Sciences of the Université d’Etat d’Haiti in 2008, I volunteered as Teaching Assistant to one of the most prominent professors of Math and Physics in Haiti, Pierre Marie Paquiot. I served for two years as a Teaching Assistant of Physics until I was awarded my fellowship for my Master’s degree at The City College of New York. To improve my teaching skills, I was selected to attend a one-month training program devoted to Teaching Assistants and Professors of the Université d’Etat d’Haiti, offered by the University of Porto-Rico and held at the Rio Piedras Campus in Porto-Rico. In 2014, my teaching experience continued to be strengthened when I became a Teaching Assistant to Dr. Michael Piasecki for his course ENGRG 59910: Introduction to Geographic Information Systems at The City College of New York. 
 

My teaching experiences, where my main role was to help the students get a deeper understanding of the course materials along with their practical aspects, coupled with my extensive self-learning experiences taught me the following invaluable lesson: one of the most effective ways to acquire or transfer knowledge is to learn by doing. In addition, the teacher must also open the students’ mind to the practical or real-world applications of concepts taught in the classroom. This certainly fosters the ability of the student to think critically and stimulates his or her curiosity while at the same time enhance the student’ interest not only in the course materials but also in related subjects. An immediate expected result from such activities is the emergence of innovative ideas and solutions powered by cross-disciplinary approaches to better and more effectively tackle current issues in the field of study. 
 

In addition to the above statements that constitute the backbone of my teaching philosophy, I strongly believe that a teacher should not limit himself or herself to exercises in textbooks. Instead, the teacher must highlight aspects of his or her research or current research trends in the field related to the course materials in the classroom. The intent is to create mutually beneficial synergies between teacher and students. Thus, not only the students will have a much-improved learning experience inspired by the immediacy and relevance of the course materials, but the teacher’s research horizon will further by the different questions brought up by the students. Last, but not least, the teacher must serve as an evangelist whose goal is to prepare the next generation of scientists in, at least, his field of research. Therefore, he or she has the responsibility to identify and stimulate the interest of his or her students for research by bringing and discussing real-world problems and needs into the classroom.
