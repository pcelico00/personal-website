# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interest is in Hydroinformatics, particularly the development and application of hardware and software technologies that resolve the chronic schematic, syntactic and semantic heterogeneities in earth sciences data sources.

description: Dr. Celicourt is a scientist with expertise in engineering informatics and its applications to earth sciences, especially hydrology (i.e., Hydroinformatics). His research interest is in the development and application of advanced hardware and software technologies for environmental conditions monitoring that resolve schematic, syntactic and semantic heterogeneities in earth sciences data sources. He has recently developed an interest in precision agriculture with a focus on the interplay between agriculture and hydroinformatics. He, accordingly, introduces agricultural water management as a new application for hydroinformatics and terms it “agricultural hydroinformatics”. A discipline-delineated conceptual framework originating from the particularities of the socio-technical dimension of applying hydroinformatics in agriculture has been developed to constitute the foundation of this new research field. The framework is suitable to support, not only integrated agricultural water resources management, but also agricultural sustainability in general, in addition to a wide range of agricultural development situations beyond connections between agro-economic and water engineering development and its socio-economic impacts.

He is currently leading the scientific team of his own start-up company, [Sensaq](http://www.sensaq.com) , which is developing a new generation of environmental data acquisition system deployable with deployment-context metadata stored onboard and can be updated and shared in a local network or over the internet as needed. Borne out his PhD Thesis in the field of Hydroinformatics, the product, named "Integrated Sensor Data Management System", actually reflects his comprehensive understanding of what is needed when monitoring the environment all the way from sensing a parameter in-situ to shepherding the measured values into a data management system so it is curated and ready for search and potential retrieval. The system is composed of an advanced sensor platform and associated software that integrates latest research from the field of Hydroinformatics. It is unique in its design and composition and is now being tested in the U.S.
