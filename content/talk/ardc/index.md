#summary: An example talk using Academic's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: 'Dataloggers constitute the de facto backbone of in-situ hydrometeorological instrumentation system. However, the process of installing datalogger-backed instrumentation systems and then streaming the data to a data management and curation system is quite complex and requires considerable human effort and cross-disciplinary technical expertise. The overall cost of ownership and operation, therefore, becomes prohibitive. This presentation will introduce a novel sensor data acquisition system composed of a sensor platform and a software framework that promotes the seamless integration of the front-end (field instrumentation) and the back-end(standards-based data management and curation system). We adopt standardized approaches to the data collection and handling processes to address the unmet and growing demand for cross-disciplinary data sources integration, discovery and interoperability. Furthermore, the effort strives to simplify to a maximum the process of programming and configuring sensing stations for deployment.'
