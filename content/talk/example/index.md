title: An Integrated Sensor Data Management System with Application in Hydrology
event: American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2018
event_url: https://example.org
location: Washington, DC, USA
#summary: An example talk using Academic's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: "Recent advances in technology have positively impacted the development of sensor networks. However, data management, a vital aspect of the sensor data collection process, has failed to keep pace. Therefore, current hydrological sensing solutions often suffer from a lack of homogenous metadata descriptions for both instrumentation and data item collected. These shortcomings may be attributed to the fact that the solutions are developed around data loggers which are not designed nor programmed to capture, operate on, and serve observations and accompanying metadata in a network. This makes sensors and sensor networks agnostic to each other and thus inherently creates the conditions for a heterogeneous mix of different semantic and syntactic systems. Such an inconsistency increases considerably the workload in the sensor post-deployment phase and human error in the installed data management system."

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Academic's [*Slides*](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further talk details can easily be added to this page using *Markdown* and $\rm \LaTeX$ math code.
