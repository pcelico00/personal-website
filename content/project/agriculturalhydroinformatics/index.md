Agricultural hydroinformatics, a new field of research in agriculture, emerges as the offspring of the interplay between agriculture and hydroinformatics. 

The field of hydroinformatics, as applied to agriculture, combines, coordinates and interplays with many scientific fields of study, and even agricultural practices, beyond hydrology, hydraulics, ecology, economics, and sociology as depicted in the above discipline-delineated conceptual framework. It originates from the particularities of the socio-technical dimension of applying hydroinformatics in agriculture and epitomizes the wholeness and inter-dependencies of agricultural systems studies and modelling. 

Hydroinformatics brings around the water-centric socio-technical transformations necessary to transitioning to sustainable agriculture practices. As such, it represents a cornerstone to implement precision agriculture which is a growingly accepted practice to achieve agricultural sustainability. In line with this vision, agricultural hydroinformatics promotes a sociotechnical-system approach to agricultural information and simulation models development. 

The framework is suitable to support, not only integrated agricultural water resources management, but also agricultural sustainability in general, in addition to a wide range of agricultural development situations beyond connections between agro-economic and water engineering development and its socio-economic impacts.
