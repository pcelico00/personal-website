Abstract

This research project aims to develop the prototype of an advanced and self-managed sensing system for groundwater table level measurements, named Irrigarinati, with networking, metadata auto-creation, and uncertainty quantification capabilities. The end goal is to enable improved real-time planning and management of groundwater resources for irrigation in horticultural farms. 

Irrigarinati will primarily consist in a) an innovative hardware component (its front-end) with the ability to auto-generate its deployment-context metadata and b) a minimal online software platform (its back-end) to organize the collected data and auto-generated metadata according to standardized data management practices.
